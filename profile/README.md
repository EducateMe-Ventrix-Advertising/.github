# THESE DOCS ARE NOT COMPLETE YET I AM MOVING THEM OVER FROM WORD

## Enable Virtualization in BIOS
Virtualization in BIOS needs to be enabled for our development environment to function. This is a key step as you will not be able to run local version of our websites without it. There are too many motherboards and BIOS configurations for us to cover in this documentation, so we can only provide you with one step:

1. Refer to your motherboard‚Äôs documentation to enable virtualization.


## Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
1. Open the Windows Store app from the Windows Start menu.
2. Search for ‚ÄúUbuntu WSL‚Äù by Canonical Group Limited:
https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PN20MSR04DW?ocid=pdpshare
3. Click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù and follow prompts.
4. Ensure that WSL is running by opening up command prompt and entering command: `wsl -l -v`


## GIT Installation
1. Navigate to https://gitforwindows.org/
2. Click ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù
3. Run Installer and follow prompts.
4. Upon completion of installation, open Command Line or PowerShell.
6. Enter command `git version` to verify that GIT installed correctly.


## Creating SSH Key
1. Open Command Line (cmd) or Git Bash.
2. Input the following line, replacing the email address within quotations with your GitHub email address:
`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C ‚Äúyour_email@example.com‚Äù`

*Example*: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C ‚Äúdeveloper@ventrixadvertising.com‚Äù`

3. When prompted to ‚ÄúEnter a file in which to save the key‚Äù, press Enter to accept the default file location.
4. Enter a passphrase to bind to the SSH key. An empty passphrase is permissible but not recommended.
5. On your Windows machine, navigate to `C:\Users\<<YOU>>\.ssh`
6. Open the contents of `id_rsa.pub` into Notepad or Notepad++
7. Copy the contents of `id_rsa.pub` to your clipboard.
8. Log into your https://github.com/ account.
9. Click user portrait and select ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù or navigate to https://github.com/settings/profile.
10. Click ‚ÄúSSH and GPG keys‚Äù.
11. Click ‚ÄúNew SSH key‚Äù.
12. Give the SSH key a title. Any title is fine, as SSH keys are NOT repository specific.
13. Paste the contents of `id_rsa.pub` into the Key field.
14. Click ‚ÄúAdd SSH key‚Äù.
